# Overview

The purpose of these modules is to demonstrate that I am proficient with coding and its many forms. The TerrariaBlockPicker is the first project, with {Add second, third, etc. project here}.

## TerrariaBlockPicker
This softwares purpose is to pick a range of blocks that have a similar color to help builders in terraria pick blocks that will work well together. You can also pick a gradient to go from the initial color and gradually go to the final color.

When building in terraria, it's important to mix textures to make builds stand out. This program is designed to make picking similar blocks for a color you want easier. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
