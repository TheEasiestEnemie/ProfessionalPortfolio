# Overview

This is a showcase to demonstrate my knowledge on threads and C#. The showcase sets up a simulation between (N) factories, a shipping truck* with (X) capacity, and (M) dealers. 

This was a passion project of mine that I really enjoyed building. I hope it does a good job of showing how I code in C# and demonstrate some of my knowledge on multithreading.

Take a look at the showcase in action down below!

# Development Environment

I used the VS Code IDE to build this project. Everything is written to the terminal. The C# plugin, C# threading, and Concurrent modules were used for this project.

# Future Work

- Fix instance of the program hanging when you increase the number of trucks.
- Allow dealers to switch between different trucks to pull from.
- Add a timer to time how long the showcase takes.

*Multiple shipping trucks is unstable, and will more than likely hang right now.
